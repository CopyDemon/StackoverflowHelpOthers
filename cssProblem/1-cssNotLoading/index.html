<!-- @Description : Overriding element's css in Nebular/Angular

@Issue:
So I am trying to change the css of the header element of the nebular theme in angular

It looks like so: https://i.stack.imgur.com/M4Ku4.png

I want it to look like this: https://i.stack.imgur.com/tnIW6.png

I am trying to separate the two elements (the "MyApp" and the actions bar). Through the console I found that I had to change the "justify-content" of the nav element embeded in the nb-header-layout to "space-between". Here is what I did

html:
<nb-layout-header class="header1">
    <app-header></app-header>
    <app-actions-bar></app-actions-bar>
</nb-layout-header>

css:

.header1 nav {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 0.5rem;
} -->
